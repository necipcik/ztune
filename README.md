ztune
======================

A guitar and bass tuner, using Pure-Data framework.
Can have two ways, or emiting the note sound (fundamental frequency) or by analysing the sound capture by the microphone, analyse and show, graphically, the note.

Eventually, add the metronome capability. But not a standard metronome, rather, a metronome capable to deal with odd time signatures, and the conjugation of different time signatures (like um bar in one time signature and the next one in a different time signature).
